# DOOM 3 BFG Edition (Windows[1], PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android, PlayStation 4[2], Xbox One[2], Nintendo Switch[2])
# DOOM 3: VR Edition (PlayStation 4[3])
# ---
# [1] this was re-released as DOOM 3 through Bethesda.net Launcher in 2019.
# [2] same case as [1], only this time targeted at different platforms.
#     however, functionality with these versions of the game won't be guaranteed with this script
#     so if i were you i'd open up an issue about it *fast* the moment i find out
#     that the script doesn't work with the game files when it comes to these versions.
# [3] an PSVR adaptation of the BFG Edition game.
